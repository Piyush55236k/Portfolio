Right now you’re trying to animate structural layout pieces (nav, full sections). That easily breaks visibility and stacking like you already experienced.

Modern sites don’t constantly move the whole layout. They animate content entering the viewport and add small, smooth transitions tied to scroll.

Use GSAP in three focused places:

1. Hero section (page1) – entrance animation on load

Goal: make the first view feel alive, not static.

Animate:

greeting text

name

role

social icons

profile image

Type: simple fade + upward slide with slight stagger.

Conceptually:

text starts slightly lower and transparent

moves up 20–30px while opacity goes 0 → 1

This runs once on page load, not on scroll.

This gives a clean, modern “reveal” instead of a sudden pop-in.

2. Section reveals on scroll (page2, page3, projects, contact)

Every major block should appear when it enters the viewport.

Animate:

section titles (ABOUT ME, SKILLS, PORTFOLIO, CONTACT)

cards in page2

each skill card

project images grid

contact form

Type: scroll-triggered fade + upward motion with stagger.

Pattern:

start slightly below (y: 40–60px, opacity: 0)

end at normal position (y: 0, opacity: 1)

trigger when section hits ~80% of viewport height

stagger children (cards, images) by small delay

This makes scrolling feel progressive and polished.

3. Parallax-style subtle motion in hero

Don’t move whole sections; move background elements slightly.

Animate:

profile image in .right

Type: slow vertical shift tied to scroll.

As user scrolls down first screen:

image moves up a little (for example y: -50 to -100px) with scrub:true

This adds depth without breaking layout.

4. Sticky/fading navbar (but subtle)

You already fade it out. Make it smoother:

Instead of instantly disappearing, let it gradually reduce opacity while scrolling through the first screen only.

Type: scroll-linked opacity (scrub).

No big movement, just fade 1 → 0 between top and bottom of page1.

5. Hover micro-interactions (no ScrollTrigger)

Use GSAP for small interactive polish:

scale project images slightly on hover

scale skill cards slightly on hover

Type:

on hover: scale to ~1.05 with quick ease

on leave: scale back to 1

These tiny interactions make the UI feel responsive and modern.

What not to animate

Don’t animate full section heights or widths.

Don’t constantly move the nav or major layout containers.

Don’t overuse large translations on scroll (looks dated and janky).

Modern feel = subtle, contextual, and staggered, not dramatic.

Good animation set for your site

Load animation (once):

stagger reveal of .intro text and .social

slight reveal of profile image

Scroll reveals (repeated per section):

fade/slide in section headings

stagger cards in .cards

stagger .image-card skills

stagger project images in .demo

fade/slide contact form fields

Hero parallax:

slow scrubbed upward move of .right img while scrolling page1

Navbar fade on scroll through page1.

Hover scale on cards and project images.

If you implement just these five patterns, your site will feel modern and animated without breaking layout or performance:

reveal on load

reveal on scroll

light parallax

smooth navbar fade

tiny hover interactions
